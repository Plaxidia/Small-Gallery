Peculiarities:

2.1. if the page width is less than 1000px then two images are wrapped on the 2nd line.

2.2. images should not be deformed in proportions.

2.3. images should be evenly spaced across the page/line width

2.4. maximum page width is limited by screen width

2.5. all images must be on the page without scrollbars

2.6. it is desirable that the height of the images be the same when increasing / decreasing the page
